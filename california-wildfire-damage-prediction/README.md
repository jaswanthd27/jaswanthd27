# 🔥 California Wildfire Damage Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict wildfire damage severity in California using post-incident building data from the CAL FIRE DINS dataset.

## 📊 Objective
To analyze and model how structural components (roof, siding, vent screens, etc.) and proximity to hazards impact building damage during wildfires.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 130,000+ entries | 46 features from 2013–Present
- EDA with visual insights on structural vulnerabilities
- Predictive modeling with:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest
- Heatmaps and clustering using Folium

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Folder Guide
- `data/` – Dataset info (actual data should not be uploaded)
- `notebooks/` – EDA and ML modeling notebooks
- `scripts/` – Data preprocessing scripts
- `results/` – Output images and performance visualizations

## 📈 Results
- Decision Tree Classifier: **82% accuracy**
- Fire-resistant materials and screened vents reduce risk
- Roof type and propane tank distance are key predictors
